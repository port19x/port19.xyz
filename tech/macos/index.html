M1 Mac Review</h1>
<p>Last Friday I rented an m1 Mac for a month to give it a thorough test drive.
Here are my thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="dejavu">
<a class="zola-anchor" href="#dejavu" aria-label="Anchor link for: dejavu">🔗</a>

DejaVu</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that I try out Mac OS.
Last time I tried it in july of 2022, ending with me returning the unit within 24 hours of purchase.
Back then I was still very adamant about customisation and when my misguided attempt to shoehorn my arch ricer setup into Mac OS failed, I gave up.
This time I’m a lot more accommodating.
I’m trying out Mac OS as intended this time, no shoe-horning!</p>
<h2 id="motivation">
<a class="zola-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Anchor link for: motivation">🔗</a>

Motivation</h2>
<p>The Motivation is also that several of the more heavy apps caused trouble on my Linux setup in recent times.
Those included mainly jetbrains IDEs necessary for college classes.
I have also kind of developed my dotfiles into a corner, with not much moving these days.
Furthermore AwesomeWM is failing at its most basic job, window management, with some windows getting stuck in full-screen seemingly at random, to a point where even closing and reopening does not fix it.</p>
<p>Combined with the fortunate financial circumstances of being able to afford an entry level M1 MacBook Air, I wanted to give Mac OS  another try.</p>

<a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-hardware" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-hardware">🔗</a>

The Hardware</h2>
<p>Let’s get the obvious out of the way, the M1 MacBook Air is an incredible piece of tech.
The Speakers and Trackpad are the best I’ll ever see in a laptop.
The build quality is perfect.
The screen and keyboard are a joy to interact with.
Only downside: lacking ports, not even a single USB-A.</p>
<p>Performance wise, it’s also pretty impressive, being able to run my most demanding compatible game: XCOM 2 at 1440p Medium, which is nowhere near playable on the Tuxedo Aura 15.</p>
<p>Let’s talk battery life. On the extreme end, 1.5 hours of XCOM 2 depleted the battery from 97 to 37%.
In more modest applications it's battery life is rather impressive, lasting for a full day of college.
The included usb-c charger appears to be of high quality with a long enough cable for my needs.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important to me, it's fanless!</p>
<p>I really like the hardware!</p>
<h2 id="initial-setup">
<a class="zola-anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-label="Anchor link for: initial-setup">🔗</a>

Initial Setup</h2>
<p>My first steps consisted of installing homebrew and enabling both FileVault and the builtin firewall.
Then I used home-brew to install Brave to replace Safari as the default browser, rectangle to enable quarter tiling and also tiling of windows via dragging/snapping.
Then I installed the other applications and utilities I use: zstd, gnupg, git, keepassxc, emacs and steam.</p>
<p>I recommend enabling tap to click as well as the option to drag windows (or other selections) via a three finger gesture.
Pro tip: a two finger click is equivalent to a traditional right click.</p>
<p>Note that I have not set up an Apple ID</p>

Mac OS Features I like</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Spotlight</em> (omg so useful)</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Usage Insights</li>
<li>Dictionary</li>
<li>Weather app</li>
<li>Productivity Trio: Calendar, Notes, Reminders</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="annoyances">
<a class="zola-anchor" href="#annoyances" aria-label="Anchor link for: annoyances">🔗</a>

Annoyances</h2>
<ul>
<li>Special characters are not where I expect them to on DE-ISO</li>
<li>No Middle-click paste</li>
<li>No Proton to make most Steam games compatible</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-i-continue-to-use-it">
<a class="zola-anchor" href="#will-i-continue-to-use-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: will-i-continue-to-use-it">🔗</a>

Will I continue to use it?</h2>
<p>Yes, I probably will.
Unless there are any surprises, I’ll be buying a base model M1 MacBook Air in December.
If I have any doubts about that purchase I may extend my current lease by another 3-6 months.
The trackpad heavy workflow of Mac OS has grown on me incredibly quickly and spotlight has shown me some great features that I’ll replicate on linux should things go south.</p>
