<p>So one week ago I decided to scrap my <a href="https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome">awesomewm</a> config in favor of <a href="https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm">EXWM</a>.
This has resulted in an noticeably more unified and fluent computing environment.
Now I can use my emacs bindings to launch and manipulate X windows!
One necessary workaround to make all my keybindings work in X windows was to add the <code>global-prefix</code> of <a href="https://github.com/noctuid/general.el">general.el</a> to the <code>exwm-input-prefix-keys</code><a href="https://github.com/port19x/dotfiles/blob/0484857d344c00c9a15bbc9ee55664e55bdda278/init.el#L90">¹</a></p>
<p>One thing I don't like is how EXWM handles workspaces, as buffers are not shared between them. <br />
Because of this I currently only use one workspace, but I may look into <a href="https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el">perspective.el</a> to replicate workspace functionality with shared buffers</p>
<p>One problem I didn't encounter nearly as much as expected was emacs locking up. <br />
With emacs being single threaded, some EXWM reviews mention that you frequently have to spam escape or C-g to kill some blocking task.
This has only happened to me once when viewing a ~20000x10000 pixel jpeg and once when I spawned mpv from dired synchronously via <code>!</code> instead of asynchronously via <code>&amp;</code></p>
<p>EXWM, once set up, comes with zero learning curve for anyone already accustomed to emacs. <br />
Since I do most of my computing in emacs anyway, the move to EXWM was a natural next step. <br />
The only scenario in which I could see myself switching back to a separate window manager would be if multi-monitor support<a href="https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki#randr-multi-screen">²</a> turns out to be poor when I'll need it again in January</p>
