  üíª PHP Language Review
</h1>

<i>First Published: 2024-07-18</i>

<hr>
<p>For quite a while now I have wanted to develop a dynamic website.<a href="https://port19.xyz/tech/webapps/">¬π</a>
In that pursuit I looked at Python Django, even going through the whole tutorial.
I was almost certain that this would be the best way to do things, but frustrations with the deployment process made me hesitant to go any deeper.</p>
<p>Luckily, a hacker news post about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40729671">mildly dynamic websites</a> gave me
the impulse to at least give PHP a quick try since the author claimed its ease of deployment to be unparalleled
and its usefulness for especially smaller applications to far exceed that of the heavyweight full-stack frameworks
like Python Django or Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>So, on a fateful evening, I thought to myself: "What's the worst that can happen?
Let's just spend an hour or two trying to make a PHP website on a platform as a service provider."</p>
<p>My expectations were that within about two hours I would get <em>something</em> up and running, but those were far exceeded.
Within less than an hour, including the time spent relearning SQL basics and creating my account at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">nearlyfreespeech.net</a>, I had a dynamic website up and running.
I took note of the <a href="https://github.com/port19x/php-monorepo/tree/master/1-origin">"speedrun checkpoints"</a>, if you want to check exactly how much time I spent on what.</p>
<p>This experiment made me very optimistic about PHP and so on the next evening I implemented
<a href="https://github.com/port19x/php-monorepo/blob/master/2-fizzbuzz/index.php">fizzbuzz</a> and about a week later I re-implemented an old project of mine, a Clash Royale kicklist generator that at the time of writing was still online.</p>
<p>In the weeks since, I have bought myself used copies of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-php-4th/9781492054122/">Programming PHP</a> and the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781449397586/">SQL Pocket Guide</a> and have made a <a href="https://github.com/port19x/php-monorepo/">monorepo</a> for future PHP projects.</p>
<p>If the positive sentiment of this little review surprises you, keep in mind that I'm talking about the old-school PHP as in <em>throw everything into a single file and use a small SQLite DB</em> PHP.
I'm not talking about the modern <em>object-oriented Laravel Symphony PHP</em> that requires a team of agile‚Ñ¢ web developers to build things with.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://phpthewrongway.com/">PHP the wrong way</a>, and I love it.</p>
