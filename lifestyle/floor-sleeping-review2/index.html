<p>I finally got it, I cracked the code.<br />
For the last nine nights I have slept on the floor and I have no intentions of going back.
Even my apple watch agrees that the sleep I now get is as restful as on my bed.</p>
<p>The last time I seriously tried this three years ago I used a 6mm yoga mat and a sleeping bag.
Now I am layering <a href="https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/trattviva-tagesdecke-dunkelgrau-60615067/">this</a> 230x250cm blanket from IKEA, folded twice on the long side, on top of the yoga mat.
Since the short side is still a bit longer than the mat, I let it overhang slightly and fold in the head side for some extra elevation.
During the day I let both the blanket and yoga mat air out.
As for sleeping positions, this works well on my back and on either side.</p>
<p>Finally I can rid myself of my most annoying possession, my bed.<br />
This is a sequel to <a href="https://port19.xyz/lifestyle/floor-sleeping-review/">my second lifestyle post</a> from 3 years ago.</p>
<p><em>Edit Oct 31st: I did this until the 24th, comfort decreased gradually with the compression of blanket and yoga mat. I also found side sleeping more unpleasant, as head elevation was difficult to maintain at the desired level. Also its cold now. I know where to proceed when I go back to the floor, but this winter I shall remain in my bed</em></p>
