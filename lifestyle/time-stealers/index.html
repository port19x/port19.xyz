  📚 Our time is being stolen
</h1>

<p><em>Rambly post incoming</em></p>
<p>Today was an ordinary day, yet if you were to ask me what I did with it I'd come up with embarrassingly little.
I can't help but feel like my time has been stolen by a combination of content brain and low stress.
It's not like I can't appreciate a day off to enjoy myself, I binged a 24 episode anime recently, but while the anime left me feeling enriched and satisfied, whatever I did today did not.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this I'm unsure what I'm trying to achieve with this piece.
We all know those shameful moments when we realize that we've fallen for a rabbit hole served by some content algorithm.
Yet I hope this resonates with someone and perhaps inspires a feeling of rebellion.</p>
<p>The problem really isn't the lack of productive advances on a Sunday. <br />
It's the total neutrality and insignificance of one earth rotation.</p>
<p>What could I have done better? <br />
Should I have ventured outside for a small hike? <br />
Should I have cleaned the kitchen? <br />
Should I have started a new programming project? <br />
Who knows! <br />
Heck, even binging another anime or watching some old movie would have been plenty.</p>
<p>Why do I default to watching youtube despite knowing it's my worst option to pass the time? <br />
Oh well...</p>
