<h2 id="where-we-left-off">Where we left off</h2>
<p>So in July of last year, following a particularly egregious impulse purchase, I started to curb my spending by following a new system.
I call it the <a href="https://port19.xyz/lifestyle/rolling-shoppinglist/">rolling shopping list</a>, and have been using it as a tool to stop impulse purchases with great effect. Yet, it hasn't been the silver bullet to solve all spending issues that I had wished it to be.</p>
<h2 id="needless-shopping">Needless shopping</h2>
<p>While I've been largely consistent in my avoidance of impulse purchases, with only one or two minor slip-ups since, not all my purchases are as great as I'd like them to be.
The reason for this can't be impulse, that variable is accounted for, but rather a discrepancy between perceived wants and actual wants.
I congratulate the advertising industry for successfully playing it's part in this.</p>
<p>Whereas with the impulse purchases of before I would receive the item and go <em>"what was I thinking!"</em>, the new needless orders have me wondering how I came to my inflated expectations that are now disappointed.</p>
<p>To illustrate, I bought a used PlayStation 3 slim recently for 89€ and while I don't flat out regret the purchase, it now sits on a shelf waiting to be used some day. More extreme would be my order of a shaker from GamerSupps, which I used once before recently throwing it away in realisation that I don't even like protein shakes or energy drinks.</p>
<h2 id="ripoff-restaurants">Ripoff Restaurants</h2>
<p>Another annoyance I deal with is the inflation in german restaurants and their decline in quality.
I can easily justify the occasional restaurant visit with friends as a social event, but can't help but feel a little ashamed for wasting 2-4 bucks for a coffee every other day.
Or 8€ for a mediocre döner kebab.</p>
<p>I'd say with my cooking skills getting better and better, as you might infer from my recently published stew recipes, it should be manageable.
It's nowhere near as bad as ~18 months ago where I set my personal record with 450€ in food expenses in a single month.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's less about the monetary cost of the food and more about the perceived gap between the price and the quality. Should I do meal prep? Idk, I'll figure something out.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I'm happy to have reduced my needless shopping over the past year, heck I even managed to avoid spending a thousand bucks on an <a href="https://port19.xyz/tech/macos/">M1 Mac</a>, I still have the unyielding urge to - occasionally - consoom product.
Oh well...</p>
