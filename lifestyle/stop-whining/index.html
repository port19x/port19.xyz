  üìö Stop Whining
</h1>

<p><em>habitual complaining is not healthy</em></p>
<h2 id="i-have-it-good">I have it good</h2>
<p>For context, me and my colleagues work at a large company in an air-conditioned building, in a small team-contained office of four people.
We get payed slightly above the industry average, have a nice canteen serving cheap tasty meals, and have free fruit baskets and coffee machines.
We have multiple high resolution monitors, pretty new laptops, ergonomic chairs and height adjustable desks.
Instead of cold-calling grandmas or writing the next marketing email to send to peoples spam folders, we do actually useful work maintaining a fleet of servers and company internal infrastructure services.
The work is varied, intellectually engaging, and frequently fun.
At least for me it is.</p>
<h2 id="yet-people-complain">Yet, people complain</h2>
<p>Yet, I see <em>several</em> of my colleagues habitually complain about expected realities of large scale IT work.
Many things don't work, yes, and some systems fail in ways that seem incredibly stupid from our high horses.
But in those cases I like to repeat the mantra that if everything worked we'd be out of a job.
I have already grown at least somewhat aggravated by this constant negativity.
For every superficial complaint, all I can hear is:
"Oh no, please rescue me from my well paid, interesting job that people would kill for"</p>
<p>There are several factors at play here. Address them and things can change.</p>
<h2 id="stoicism-101">Stoicism 101</h2>
<p>Some things are within your control while others are not.
If you can't fix something because it's outside your control, accept it and work on the things that are within your control.
Maybe shoot your manager an email, but then shut up about it.</p>
<h2 id="gratitude-entitlement">Gratitude &gt; Entitlement</h2>
<p>Think about the insurance sales guy from my exposition.
Think about every manual labourer and every customer service worker in existence.
You're earning an above median salary to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day and solve funny IT issues.
If you really think it's so bad, why don't you intern at a mc donalds during your next vacation and see how you like that.</p>
<h2 id="inflationary-whining">Inflationary Whining</h2>
<p>Complaining on occasion is fine. A bit of cursing gives spice to the day.
But when you complain about the fact that there is work to do, at work, what are you even complaining about?
Sooner rather than later I'll just mentally put you into the chronically-negative-person box.
And once you're in there, the chances that I'll pay attention when there is something legitimate to whine about are greatly diminished.</p>
<h2 id="respect-slander">Respect &gt; Slander</h2>
<p><strong>Don't cope with your insecurities by putting others down.</strong></p>
<p>You know things that colleagues in other departments don't. Great.
This doesn't mean that the colleagues in those other departments are donkeys that just learned reading and writing.
And if they legitimately are at a lower level of competency, there is a good chance that their salary reflects that.
More often than not the actual impedance to better work is overbearing process anyway.
In those cases you should slander higher management, not your colleagues in other departments.</p>
<p>Also, while I'm on the topic, slandering previous team colleagues is like a girl complaining about her ex. Ick at best, red flag at worst.</p>
<h2 id="applications-outside-the-workplace">Applications outside the workplace</h2>
<p>I guess you could apply this rationale to politics, countries and fellow citizens.
Constantly complaining about the problems in a first world country or a war that is more than a border away is similarly unhealthy.
Although given the negativity bias of the news I find it much easier to forgive the whining about political issues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For my international readers, Germans have a tendency to complain more than other cultures do, so this may not resemble your situation.
Yet, I hope you too can take something away from this and develop a more positive outlook.</p>
<p>The irony that this post complains about other people complaining is not lost on me btw.</p>
