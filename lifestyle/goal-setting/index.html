  üìö Goal Setting
</h1>

<i>First Published: 2023-10-20</i>

<p>Setting goals is one of the best ways to ensure you stay on track and keep improving yourself. <br />
In this post I want to reveal my method of goal setting and it's supporting heuristics.</p>
<h2 id="smart-er">SMART (-er)</h2>
<p>Just to get this out of the way: yes, I am familiar with the SMART acronym and employ it's heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timed, <em>Evaluate, Reward</em>\</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>Of these heuristics I find Measurability, Actionability, Timing and Evaluation significantly more important than Specificity, Relevancy or Reward.
I won't waste time assessing relevancy in depth, and also don't need my goals to be more specific than what is necessary to fulfill the other heuristics of measurability and actionability.
As a reward, since I fortunately already have everything I want, I usually go for a nice meal downtown.</p>
<h2 id="frequency-and-dismissal">Frequency and Dismissal</h2>
<p>Goals come in various shapes and sizes and deserve different treatment because of it. <br />
I don't set new long-term/yearly goals more than once a quarter at most, and when I do, I set one at a time.</p>
<p>More short term goals, quarterly or monthly goals, usually come in groups of up to ten. <br />
A couple of weeks into a quarter, or days into the month I reevaluate, discarding around half of them. <br />
This can be seen with the <a href="https://port19.xyz/tech/status-update-2309/">Q4 goals</a> I shared recently.
I started setting up syncplay and jitsi, but then discarded those goals due to a change in perspective regarding their value proposition and operational difficulty.
Sometimes it's new information that makes a goal obsolete, such as with my arch-mirror and netcup migration goals.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb I set many short-term goals, but dismiss most of them quickly. <br />
I prefer trying out several short-term goals to over-analyzing them in advance.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-talk-about-it">Don't talk about it</h2>
<p>For long-term goals: don't tell anyone. <br />
Not telling anyone drastically increases your chances of sticking to and achieving your goal. \</p>
<h2 id="fun-goals">Fun goals</h2>
<p>One more thing I occasionally do that may appear strange is to set, for lack of a better term, fun goals. <br />
Like this month I set and achieved the goal to watch at least two anime series. <br />
I treat fun goals as no less important than regular productivity goals. <br />
This greatly helps to balance out any toxic perfectionism.</p>
<h2 id="start-small">Start small</h2>
<p>My system has matured to be this elaborate over years. <br />
Goal setting takes practice and doesn't need to be a consistent practice to yield results. <br />
I don't set new goals every month if I don't feel like it. \</p>
<p>Chances are you set a goal for this year. Are you on track? <br />
If you are not, is there a smaller sub-goal that you can still achieve this year?</p>
