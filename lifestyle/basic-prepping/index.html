  üìö Basic Prepping
</h1>

<i>First Published: 2025-08-06</i>

<hr>
<p>In February I played the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/282070/This_War_of_Mine/">This War Of Mine</a>, in which you play a civilian surviving during war. It's a very fun resource management type game and is what got me interested in the topic.
By the end of April, I was pretty much done with my prepping, but I didn't feel like making a post out of it until now.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>This is not intended to keep you alive indefinitely in a true <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shtf">SHTF</a> scenario.
It's supposed to give you a baseline for lasting 14 days, enough for any natural disaster or infrastructure outage to blow over for the foreseeable future.
I base all of this on information provided by the <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/EN/Prepare-for-disasters/Personal-Preparedness/personal-preparedness_node.html">german federal office of civil protection and disaster assistance</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzbsmrchwzY">this youtube video</a>.</p>
<h2 id="water-30eur">Water (~30‚Ç¨)</h2>
<p>Drinking water is pretty important. 2 Liters per person per day is a good start, although I prefer to plan with 3 liters per day for myself.
I emphasise water over food, and have a goal capacity of 90 liters, which should last a month.</p>
<p>Also having some kind of container to capture rain water is a good idea since you can use subpar quality water for hygienic purposes.
If you have a bathtub, getting a water bladder for it makes sense, since water infrastructure is usually more resilient to faults than electricity.</p>
<h2 id="food-100eur">Food (~100‚Ç¨)</h2>
<p>I guess you can do just beans and rice if you want to be the stereotype.
I prefer having about a kilogram of nut mix, with a quarter each of almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts and cashews.
Dark chocolate is a staple of my diet and lasts for a year so I have about a kilogram of that stored in any given time.
Milk and cereal is good.
Pasta and canned chopped tomatoes are good.
Canned fruit is a waste of space due to low calorie density, but you can add one or two cans for variety.</p>
<p>Make sure you also have a plan for preparing the food you do have.
Although if your planning horizon is two weeks, you'll be fine with just having a sufficient amount of foods that are consumable without preparation.
I'm not satisfied with my current protein planning, beef jerky is way too sweet and the canned pork I tried is extremely salty.
Any recommendations are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I also welcome any pointers regarding the beans and rice meta, I have no clue how to make a coherent meal with those.</p>
<h2 id="medical-100eur">Medical (~100‚Ç¨)</h2>
<p>Get yourself a first aid kit, like the ones used in cars. <a href="https://geizhals.eu/leina-werke-kfz-verbandkasten-standard-schwarz-10002-a2004018.html">(example)</a> <br />
Additionally, get the following as a medicinal baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain Killer: Paracetamol (less side effects) or an NSAID like ibuprofen or aspirin</li>
<li>Electrolytes for diarrhea</li>
<li>Burn/wound cream</li>
<li>Wound disinfectant</li>
<li>Hand disinfectant</li>
<li>Gloves</li>
<li>FFP2 Masks</li>
<li>Regular Masks</li>
<li>Sunscreen</li>
<li>Fever thermometer</li>
<li>Tweezers</li>
</ul>
<p>Also get yourself the necessary tools to take care of your usual problem area in terms of health.
In my case I added a blood pressure monitor and blood oxygen sensor to be able to monitor any heart issues.
They are pretty good now, but in times of malnutrition I'm sure they would creep up again, and at least with the heart you can run some diagnostics.</p>
<h2 id="radio-30eur">Radio (~30‚Ç¨)</h2>
<p>Get a cheap battery powered radio and a dozen or two batteries of 2-3 different kinds. <br />
Radio stations are core parts of the disaster plans of nations since they are purely broadcast based and you only need a passive receiver.
You'll receive important communications via radio, whether the status of the current natural disaster, or even in an SHTF scenario.
Even a weather forecast and a bit of background music can be useful.</p>
<h2 id="energy-500-eur-or-80eur">Energy (500+‚Ç¨ or 80‚Ç¨)</h2>
<p>It makes sense to buy a solar generator if you have the necessary funds.
Having access to at least your offline electronic media library can keep spirits high when material conditions are subpar.</p>
<p>A minimalist approach could also be to get a power bank with a solar panel that's just enough to charge your phone with. This way you stay under 100‚Ç¨ and can still access your downloaded media that way, including topical ebooks which become interesting once you scale to SHTF prepping. <a href="https://geizhals.eu/sandberg-solar-6-panel-powerbank-20000-schwarz-420-73-a2796676.html">(example)</a></p>
<p>Also make sure you at least have a book or two for backup.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This standard of prepping is reasonably cheap, and can benefit you even if you just get sick for a week or two and don't want to leave the house for that reason.
You can proceed to build up to a full SHTF Prep, but at that point it becomes its own hobby and the objective risk management returns diminish.</p>
