## Base

### [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)

While I have mostly used Arch in the past, Mint has always been my second favorite distro.
Now that my computer usage is becoming less technical as I turn away from my career in IT, I thought it would be wise to migrate to a "just works" or "beginner friendly" linux distro.
This strikes a middle ground between the polish of mac os that comes at the price of terrible gaming and scripting, and the very hands on nature of my custom arch setup.
I make minimal adjustments to Linux Mint, only installing a small handful of packages that are documented in the readme of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/port19x/dotfiles) repo.

### [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)

I'm currently using librewolf as my primary web browser.
I like it due to it's unparalleled out-of-the-box security and privacy.
For security reasons I use the flatpak version over the native package.
I've also extensively used both [Brave](https://brave.com/) and [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) in the past and can recommend them for speed and keyboard driven operation respectively.

## Multimedia

### [MPV](https://mpv.io/)

My media player of choice is mpv, it's great for both audio and video and the dominant choice among linux users.
To mac users I can recommend [IINA](https://iina.io/).

### [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)

I use ffmpeg to record audio and video, to do basic audio post-processing and to convert between the various encoders and container formats.
If you're on linux it's likely already installed as a dependency to something else.

### [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/)

I use imagemagick to do all my basic image conversion and editing. \
This includes cropping, scaling, captions, appending, rotation. \
For anything more advanced, which I only need to do every few months, I use [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

### [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/)

Poppler is a great little library for basic pdf editing, like splitting and concatenation.

### [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

With yt-dlp I download youtube videos, music, or full channels even. \
Enough said.

## Writing

### This Website

I've written at length about all the various components that go into this website. \
Check out my blog post on it [here](https://port19.xyz/tech/blog/).

### [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)

I wrote all my academic papers in emacs org-mode using the latex export. \
This is a pretty common setup among emacs users.

### [LaTeX Beamer](https://latex-beamer.com/quick-start/)

I also did my college presentations in emacs org-mode, leveraging latex beamer. \
One nice feature of latex beamer I've seen nowhere else is the progress indicator at the top.

### [LaTeX Moderncv](https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv)

I format job applications via LaTeX ModernCV and can highly recommend it to stand out amongst the mountain of poorly typeset CVs made in Microsoft word. \
I use the banking style and prefer a red accent color.

### [Aspell](http://aspell.net/)

My spell checker of choice is aspell, which I frequently invoke through `ispell` in emacs. \
It has it's flaws, if you know of something better on linux please let me know.
