## Nursing Internship

My nursing internship in the last week of march was certainly interesting.
It started with an early shift from 7:30 am until 1:30 pm, which was my record in terms of steps per day this year: 20k steps and 360 stand minutes according to my apple watch.
That is a lot for now, but I could get used to that with some training leading up to it.
My job was mostly to make the beds, fetch material and disinfect the rooms. \
On the second day the shift started a bit earlier but I was able to get by with fewer steps because I fed one of the maximally impaired residents which took quite a while. \
On the third day I woke up exhausted with a sore throat and slightly elevated overnight heart rate. Since I got a good impression of the job already and didn't want to get sick or spread my virus to the elderly, I called it quits. I managed to fend off that flu.

The job is exactly how I imagined it to be, but one big issue I could not have seen coming was my sensitivity to the smells.
I didn't really mind the mild urine odour in over half the rooms, but feces stinks quite bad.
Aside from smells nothing bothered me, not the sound of rattling breath, not the sight of naked old people or even the soma of a resident.
Honestly the housekeeping tasks were kind of fun, so maybe I should try a hotel job next.

I won't rule out nursing completely, but its not my first pick for right now.

## How I pass the time

In the meantime, I've started to build up some provisions according to our ministry for natural disasters using this [checklist](https://www.bbk.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Mediathek/Publikationen/Buergerinformationen/Ratgeber/ratgeber-notfallvosorge-checkliste.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=7).
In terms of exercise I've shifted my focus from running to regular walks in the forest after a mild knee injury caught me off guard. Additionally, I added this [yoga routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o0kNeOyH98) to most of my evenings.
Of course I've also continued to play a bunch of video games, currently I'm in my second run through castlevania symphony of the night, a game I can highly recommend.
But enough rambling about my NEET lifestyle, whats my plan from here?

## Career Prospects

First of all I'm not in a hurry to get my next job. But once my boredom reaches a certain point, likely sometime next month, I'll send out some applications again.
It would be the wisest choice to just give IT a second chance at another employer, maybe a smaller company and a position with a slightly different focus.

But in the medium to long term everything is still on the table.
If my fitness wasn't at such a low point right now, military service would be fun.
I could also try out a generic chill minimum wage job, especially if/when they bump the minimum wage again.

I will post another update if something materialises, until then you may check out my [retro gaming](https://port19.xyz/retro-games/) list for updates on what I'm up to.
