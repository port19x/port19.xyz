Since I bought myself some used Apple hardware at the end of June, I'm now writing a consolidated review on it.

## MacBook

The M1 MacBook Air was the first piece of Apple hardware that I bought and cost me 630â‚¬.
There were no further surprises and everything I said about the M1 MacBook Air and about MacOS in [my review](https://port19.xyz/tech/macos/) of last year still applies.
While it cost by far the most I consider the M1 MacBook Air to be the most useful of the three items I bought.

I should note that at work I continue to use a Linux PC with Emacs and strongly prefer that setup for productivity.

## iPhone

Shortly after the MacBook Air, I bought myself an iPhone XS that set me back 80â‚¬, plus another 10 for a case.
Despite it being heavily used, it still gets me around two and a half days of battery life, given my very light usage.
The only third party apps I have installed on it right now are [SpendNotes](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/spendnotes-budget-tracker/id1505752740?l=ar?l=ar) for expense tracking and [Medito](https://meditofoundation.org/) for guided meditations.

What I don't use in third-party apps I make up for in first-party apps.
Synchronizing with the MacBook Air, I like to use Apple notes, reminders and the calendar.
And also found it quite useful to have my photos synchronized between the devices.

~With iOS apps working natively on the MacBook, I plan on relegating the
iPhone to the drawer and to continue using my dumb phone, as I've done for the past two years.~

*Doesn't work nearly as well as it seems at first glance. Also, turns out old phone is starting to get battery issues. iPhone stays default.*

## Apple Watch

The Apple Watch is a heavily used series 6 that I purchased for 60â‚¬, with it arriving only two days ago.
I primarily tested it for workout tracking and apple pay and I also tested the apple maps navigation once.
I did also test the sleep tracking, but find that to be kind of useless given my near-perfect sleep.

I think an Apple Watch is a poor fashion choice and not really worth over a hundred bucks unless you are a cyclist
that will make frequent use of both the navigation feature and workout tracking.

~But for those two features it's useful enough to keep around and use occasionally.~

*I'll keep using it as my default and keep my analogue watches around for when I need to dress up.*

## Misc

iCloud Web doesn't work for me with advanced data protection enabled. Useless.

A cheap iPad might be nice for media consumption and/or diagramming via apple freeform.
Without having tried it, I'll recommend it to moms and startup techbros.[Â¹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#/media/File:Business_Model_Canvas.png)

## Conclusion

Apple has some nice hardware available at decent prices on the used market.
If you're the kind of guy who will make use of it, it surely isn't a bad choice.
~But for me, I think I'll refocus on the essentials and continue using a regular watch with a dumbphone while also leveraging the M1 MacBook Air to its fullest potential.~
*Sike*
