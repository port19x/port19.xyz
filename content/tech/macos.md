# M1 Mac Review

Last Friday I rented an m1 Mac for a month to give it a thorough test drive.
Here are my thoughts.

## DejaVu

This is not the first time that I try out Mac OS.
Last time I tried it in july of 2022, ending with me returning the unit within 24 hours of purchase.
Back then I was still very adamant about customisation and when my misguided attempt to shoehorn my arch ricer setup into Mac OS failed, I gave up.
This time Iâ€™m a lot more accommodating.
Iâ€™m trying out Mac OS as intended this time, no shoe-horning!

## Motivation

The Motivation is also that several of the more heavy apps caused trouble on my Linux setup in recent times.
Those included mainly jetbrains IDEs necessary for college classes.
I have also kind of developed my dotfiles into a corner, with not much moving these days.
Furthermore AwesomeWM is failing at its most basic job, window management, with some windows getting stuck in full-screen seemingly at random, to a point where even closing and reopening does not fix it.

Combined with the fortunate financial circumstances of being able to afford an entry level M1 MacBook Air, I wanted to give Mac OS  another try.

## The Hardware

Letâ€™s get the obvious out of the way, the M1 MacBook Air is an incredible piece of tech.
The Speakers and Trackpad are the best Iâ€™ll ever see in a laptop.
The build quality is perfect.
The screen and keyboard are a joy to interact with.
Only downside: lacking ports, not even a single USB-A.

Performance wise, itâ€™s also pretty impressive, being able to run my most demanding compatible game: XCOM 2 at 1440p Medium, which is nowhere near playable on the Tuxedo Aura 15.

Letâ€™s talk battery life. On the extreme end, 1.5 hours of XCOM 2 depleted the battery from 97 to 37%.
In more modest applications it's battery life rather impressive, lasting for a full day of college.
The included usb-c charger appears to be of high quality with a long enough cable for my needs.

Perhaps most important to me, it's fanless!

I really like the hardware!

## Initial Setup

My first steps consisted of installing homebrew and enabling both FileVault and the builtin firewall.
Then I used home-brew to install Brave to replace Safari as the default browser, rectangle to enable quarter tiling and also tiling of windows via dragging/snapping.
Then I installed the other applications and utilities I use: zstd, gnupg, git, keepassxc, emacs and steam.

I recommend enabling tap to click as well as the option to drag windows (or other selections) via a three finger gesture.
Pro tip: a two finger click is equivalent to a traditional right click.

Note that I have not set up an Apple ID

## Mac OS Features I like
- *Spotlight* (omg so useful)
- Permissions
- Usage Insights
- Dictionary
- Weather app
- Productivity Trio: Calendar, Notes, Reminders

## Annoyances
- Special characters are not where I expect them to on DE-ISO
- No Middle-click paste
- No Proton to make most Steam games compatible

## Will I continue to use it?

Yes, I probably will.
Unless there are any surprises, Iâ€™ll be buying a base model M1 MacBook Air in December.
If I have any doubts about that purchase I may extend my current lease by another 3-6 months.
The trackpad heavy workflow of Mac OS has grown on me incredibly quickly and spotlight has shown me some great features that Iâ€™ll replicate on linux should things go south.
