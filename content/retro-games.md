<!-- NES sucks, but I played bubble bobble, tetris and kirbys adventure on it. Covers suck too, so I'm not including them-->

## Completed (Consoles)

### N64

I tried and quickly quit the other 3d platformers, they suck.\
Not big into the N64 racing games either.\
I tried Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, but the controls aged terribly.\
Zelda OOT is a great game objectively, but something about the gameplay just didn't click with me so I just kinda stopped playing about 10 hours in.

### PSX
The 3D graphics suck.\
I tried and disliked metal gear solid and crash bandicoot.\
RPGs would be plentiful, but where are they not?\
Some games I may play as ports on later systems.

## Sourcing & Emulation

[Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/) is good for curated nointro and redump romsets.\
[Romsfun](https://romsfun.com/) is my current fallback site.

I use [Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org/) as the OS for all my retro gaming needs.\
My Gamepad is a black [8bitdo pro 2.](https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/)\

## PC

Since the beginning of 2024 I have largely dropped PC gaming in favour of retro games.
However in the ~5 years before that I played a fair bit of PC, and as such my favourites deserve their fair mention on my site.
The following 6 are games I can wholeheartedly recommend.
They are well described and tagged on steam, you'll definitely know if you like them within the 2 hour steam return window.
