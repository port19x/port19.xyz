<!-- NES sucks, but I played bubble bobble, tetris and kirbys adventure on it. Covers suck too, so I'm not including them-->

## Sourcing & Emulation

Pick games for one of the top100 lists on gamefaqs:
[SNES](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/916396-super-nintendo/76022917),
[GBA](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/916598-game-boy-advance/66659387),
[N64](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/916387-nintendo-64/78772770),
[GC](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/915781-gamecube/79516002),
[PS2](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/915821-playstation-2/79518850),
I tend to stick to the top 20, with some franchise / genre specific exceptions. \
[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) is a decent fallback for finding good games.

- Use archive.org nointro roms: [SNES](https://archive.org/download/nointro.snes), [GBA](https://archive.org/download/nointro.gba), [N64](https://archive.org/download/nointro.n64)
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/) for more recent stuff like PS2 and Gamecube
- I used [emulatorgames](https://www.emulatorgames.net/) before I learned about nointro rom sets

Gamefaqs is also by far the best to find walkthroughs if you get stuck.

<br>

[Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org/) is a nice retro emulation os that I plan to set up for everything except PS3. \
I play PS3 games on original hardware.

## PC

Since the beginning of 2024 I have largely dropped PC gaming in favour of retro games.
However in the ~5 years before that I played a fair bit of PC, and as such my favourites deserve their fair mention on my site.
The following 6 are games I can wholeheartedly recommend.
They are well described and tagged on steam, you'll definitely know if you like them within the 2 hour steam return window.
