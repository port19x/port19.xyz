<h2 id="base">Base</h2>
<h3 id="linux-mint"><a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a></h3>
<p>While I have mostly used Arch in the past, Mint has always been my second favorite distro.
Now that my computer usage is becoming less technical as I turn away from my career in IT, I thought it would be wise to migrate to a "just works" or "beginner friendly" linux distro.
This strikes a middle ground between the polish of mac os that comes at the price of terrible gaming and scripting, and the very hands on nature of my custom arch setup.
I make minimal adjustments to Linux Mint, only installing a small handful of packages that are documented in the readme of my <a href="https://github.com/port19x/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repo.</p>
<h3 id="librewolf"><a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a></h3>
<p>I'm currently using librewolf as my primary web browser.
I like it due to it's unparalleled out-of-the-box security and privacy.
For security reasons I use the flatpak version over the native package.
I've also extensively used both <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> and <a href="https://qutebrowser.org/">Qutebrowser</a> in the past and can recommend them for speed and keyboard driven operation respectively.</p>
<h2 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h2>
<h3 id="mpv"><a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a></h3>
<p>My media player of choice is mpv, it's great for both audio and video and the dominant choice among linux users.
To mac users I can recommend <a href="https://iina.io/">IINA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ffmpeg"><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a></h3>
<p>I use ffmpeg to record audio and video, to do basic audio post-processing and to convert between the various encoders and container formats.
If you're on linux it's likely already installed as a dependency to something else.</p>
<h3 id="imagemagick"><a href="https://imagemagick.org/">Imagemagick</a></h3>
<p>I use imagemagick to do all my basic image conversion and editing. <br />
This includes cropping, scaling, captions, appending, rotation. <br />
For anything more advanced, which I only need to do every few months, I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a>.</p>
<h3 id="poppler"><a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">Poppler</a></h3>
<p>Poppler is a great little library for basic pdf editing, like splitting and concatenation.</p>
<h3 id="yt-dlp"><a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">YT-DLP</a></h3>
<p>With yt-dlp I download youtube videos, music, or full channels even. <br />
Enough said.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<h3 id="this-website">This Website</h3>
<p>I've written at length about all the various components that go into this website. <br />
Check out my blog post on it <a href="https://port19.xyz/tech/blog/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="latex"><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></h3>
<p>I wrote all my academic papers in emacs org-mode using the latex export. <br />
This is a pretty common setup among emacs users.</p>
<h3 id="latex-beamer"><a href="https://latex-beamer.com/quick-start/">LaTeX Beamer</a></h3>
<p>I also did my college presentations in emacs org-mode, leveraging latex beamer. <br />
One nice feature of latex beamer I've seen nowhere else is the progress indicator at the top.</p>
<h3 id="latex-moderncv"><a href="https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv">LaTeX Moderncv</a></h3>
<p>I format job applications via LaTeX ModernCV and can highly recommend it to stand out amongst the mountain of poorly typeset CVs made in Microsoft word. <br />
I use the banking style and prefer a red accent color.</p>
<h3 id="aspell"><a href="http://aspell.net/">Aspell</a></h3>
<p>My spell checker of choice is aspell, which I frequently invoke through <code>ispell</code> in emacs. <br />
It has it's flaws, if you know of something better on linux please let me know.</p>
