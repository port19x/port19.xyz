  ðŸ“š Cold Shower Review

<p><em>tldr: very worth it</em></p>
<p>So after many months of this rotting on my bucket list and the many contrast showers I had taken in the past, yesterday I finally took a proper cold shower.
To get the terminology out of the way: A contrast shower is when you start the shower hot and end it cold, possibly flicking back and forth between the two a few times.
A cold shower means turning the handle all the way to it's coldest setting before jumping in.</p>
<p>My cold shower went like this: I hyped myself up for a few minutes, unsure of what would await me.
Then I got into the shower, and took several deep breaths before turning on the cold water.
It was a big shock, haven't felt this much adrenaline in months, I breathed fast and heavily.
After what must have been 20 seconds, after my whole body was wet, the initial shock cooled down <em>(pun intended)</em>, my breath stabilized and I could think clearly again.
I stayed in the shower for another 3 minutes, taking in this meditative experience and giving into the cold.</p>
<p>After having turned the shower off, while drying myself, I couldn't help but laugh.
I can't overstate the intensity of this experience, I haven't felt so alive in months.
I did not worry about the future or think about the past, I was just present and happy.
And that was just the mental side, my body felt like it was wrapped in an aura of purity and cold, like I was wearing some magical armor, like all my cells had died and been reborn. I felt invincible.
In the minutes that followed, the intensity of my experience decreased, and gave way to a deep feeling of peace.
When I went to bed a few minutes later, I fell asleep right away.</p>
<p><strong>You can do it too</strong></p>
<p>If you're afraid, great, that's the point, everyone is. <br />
